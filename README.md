## What is this?

This is a very basic analysis of speeches given at the 2016 Republican and
Democratic National Conventions. After watching the RNC, and among my many
observations was that there was much more talk of Hillary and Obama than about
Donald Trump.

## Results

See [results.csv!](results.csv).

## Methodology

The methodology used here is relatively rudimentary. A case-insensitive regular
expression is used to search for various words used throughout the speeches.
Those words are counted and collected into a CSV, grouped by speaker.

## Limitations

First, I've only included most of what comprised of the "prime time" speeches,
though, the analysis is certainly not exhaustive. This is mostly due to the time
involved of hunting down each speech transcript of every speaker at the RNC.

There are far more sophisticated ways to analyze these speeches. I don't have
experience in natural language processing and analysis. Thus, I used the simplest
method I could think of.

## Future

The main thing that I would like to add to this analysis is historical context.
That is, I would like to compare this year's convention speeches to prior years
for both parties.

## Contributions

modifying or adding to the analysis, etc, please submit a pull request. Your contribution is highly appreciated.
